              The International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) is the world's most
              prestigious annual competition for secondary school chemistry
              students. Since its inception in 1968 in Czechoslovakia, the IChO
              has grown to include over 90 countries, bringing together the
              brightest young minds in chemistry from around the globe.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Each year, exceptional students compete in both theoretical and
              practical examinations, demonstrating their mastery of chemistry
              through rigorous 5-hour sessions that test their knowledge,
              problem-solving abilities, and laboratory skills.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The competition celebrates individual achievement rather than team
              scores, with medals and honors awarded to recognize outstanding
              performance and foster international scientific collaboration.
            </p>

              In 2026, the International Chemistry Olympiad will be hosted by
              Uzbekistan for the first time in its history. This significant
              occasion reflects Uzbekistanâ€™s growing commitment to advancing
              science and education, while also providing an opportunity to
              present its achievements on the global stage. The event is
              expected to contribute to the development of scientific potential
              in the region and inspire a new generation of students to pursue
              excellence in chemistry.
